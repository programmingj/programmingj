I have played some kind of instrument since I was 8 and have played the piano/keyboards since I was 12. <br /><br />But ever since getting my first computer, a Commodore Vic 20, and trying to run games when I was about 12 or 13, having to reconfigure the boot parameters for every single game just about I learned really fast how the hardware worked and I wanted to know more! I wanted to know everything!
